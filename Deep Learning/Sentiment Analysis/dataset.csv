I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it. They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work. And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed. Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.

75," Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines. I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed. Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them. It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them. And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended). Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in. Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba? Probably not ever again. I'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba. Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.",negative,LAPTOP_QUALITY

I bought a protector for my key pad and it works great :) This is definitely a computer worth the money; The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly. AND the best part is that it even comes with a free printer (when they have a certain promotion/offer going, of course)! Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.

100," Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously). It even has a great webcam, and Skype works very well. The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine. The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics. I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price. This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks. I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!). Finally, I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time. ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town. If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before! I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person! Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up! I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!

It took some getting used to on the Widows 8.1, after being an XP user for many years. Everything seems to be running smoothly. Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software. They are fine while the free subscription is going, but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login. Device is light weight, quiet during operation and produces little to no heat. It has a quick start up and shut down time. The display is good quality.

154," This laptop is nice. It has a decent feel to it, sharp display and is fast enough. The biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive. So frustrating!! I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available, but nothing has helped. Also, the touchpad is almost 'sticky', which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad. I would love to keep this laptop, but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand. No Lenovo for me.",neutral,LAPTOP_QUALITY

156," It's an amazing laptop. Most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad. The laptop is fast. The Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome. Now I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it's not got too slow either. I am loving it completely. It does make a little noise but that's alright as it's not too much. It doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage. But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying. I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else. HP please fix it. A smaller touchpad would make life easier for Computer Science students or IT people much more easier.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

157," No laptop is perfect, but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you. This laptop does everything I need it to very well. I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room; the two of us use it regularly. I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV. The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features. The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice; I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would. Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos. For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any; the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on. I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it. I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff. Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds. This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it. I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff. Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds. This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card. Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase. I looked around and based off my price/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here.",neutral,GRAPHICS_DESIGN_FEATURES

So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty. 2 months later, the battery went. They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die. THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went. I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop. Not worth it one bit. The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory. Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use. Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose. And it is impossible to get them back in.",positive,LAPTOP_OPERATION_PERFORMANCE

160, Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09. Bought with a credit card. Probbly the worst decision we ever made! It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard! the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one. the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon! pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were. i love the size of the computer since i play games on it. i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have. also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard. So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer,negative,LAPTOP_GENERAL

161, I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty. The computer was shipped to their repair depot  on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned. I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot. They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place. The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba. The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue. Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky. By Air sounds more like by truck to Me. And Toshiba is totally unconcerned. The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter. We don't Mind and You don't Matter. I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.

When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself. Also, the battery does not last very long at all. I would recommend not buying this product. I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem. I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with. Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly. Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.

They say sorry out of warranty. Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period. Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine. They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything. Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook. So buyer beware when buying Toshiba,negative,LAPTOP_CONNECTIVITY

201, I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off. Apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached. I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly. I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem. I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.,positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

205," I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops. I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it. I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased. So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority. The only thing I didn't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc. I don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time. Those things are very important - vital even! So think about factoring those things in when you purchase. I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.

Machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen. 5.Best to use the power supply for 4K video viewing. Battery power laptop had difficulties computing. 6.Still feels too heavy to me. Could lose another pound or two. 7.Expensive. Paid close to $2800 out the door. There are too many things to test. Will update my review when I have time.,neutral,LAPTOP_GENERAL

269," This computer had exactly the specifications I needed. Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips. The perfect notebook... When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed. The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port. Called tech support and got the usual Acer ""We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you"" I explained there was no software involved in booting. No, tey don't even support their own bios and it ""could be a problem with the bios"" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!

The pictures are clear as can be. If I had to buy another computer, I would most definetly buy an acer one computer. Heck, if I had enough ' money, I would but it as a gift for someone. Im glad that it has such great features in it. It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home. Clear picture on it and everything. The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer. The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it. Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.

273, I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied. The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones. Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it. That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed. It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back. ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. I babyed the heck out of it and i still do. To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. The graphics are great. The internet speed is spectacular. The battery life is probably an hour at best. Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good. I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about. I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.,positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed. It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back. ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke. I babyed the heck out of it and i still do. To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk. The graphics are great. The internet speed is spectacular. The battery life is probably an hour at best. Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good. I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about. I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.,negative,LAPTOP_QUALITY

This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered. It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes. I promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine. The second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge. And I have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them! What a lemon!!",negative,LAPTOP_QUALITY

295," It's truly a great laptop for the price. I built my own gaming pc with a intel i5-4590 in it and a gtx 760 so I know what crazy performance on a computer can come to. However, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years. For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value. It is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me. I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well. BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards. If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming. Overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing. Would definitely recommend for those who are ""technologically ignorant""",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

297," First, it does not have a push button to open the lid. It is held in place magnetically. There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that. Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp. This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design. Using this machine is like a mild form of torture. In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con). The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare. I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening. Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it. I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would. It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features. I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use. Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac. It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind. My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary. I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible.

I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college. I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers. I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC. It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow. My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple. Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for. I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use. I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me. I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket. Money and time well spent! Highly recommended!",positive,LAPTOP_PRICE

Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient. I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college. I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers. I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC. It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow. My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple. Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for. I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.

301," With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone. I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION. Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working. Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us. I called back to ensure that received it, they had. But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!! Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time. This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped. Asked the customer service rep. If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step. The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question. Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site. I'm tired of the inept service. If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!! Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small. I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!! I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!",negative,SUPPORT_QUALITY

302," I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market. I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office. They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat. I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there. I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times. This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables. You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast. I also experience the same with my MacBook Air. So you might ask, what did Apple do for me? For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this). Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.

The letter A stopped working after the first week. when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase. not the day received. so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault. they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem. they have not sent a new one nor called. i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus. then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east. So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand. Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to. its sad because their commercials are great.",negative,LAPTOP_GENERAL

(I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents. My ONLY issues are: the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60 That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently. The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.

312," The worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon. Firstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing. Ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on. The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled. Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.

The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers. I am a college student and it has been very useful. It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer. It has a lot of memory and a great battery life. It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed. Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.

Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around. The unibody design is edgy and durable. The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more. I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages. Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker. A key contributor that led me to Mac is the art aspect. They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular. I'm excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same. It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.",positive,LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES

I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems! The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.

329," I am a freelance graphic artist. I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently. This machine delivers. It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz. It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine. I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers. It is a bit heavy. It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required. If that is the case for you, I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases. Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in. This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop. Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch. You may need to special order a bag. It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags. I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model. It also does not have bluetooth. Pay attention to the specs if you want these options. You'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them. I should have been more observant. I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard. They are not. Overall, still a very nice machine.

Its also worth noting that there no bluetooth, no mircophone jack, no ethernet, no dvd/cd drive/burner, and no usb 3.0 ports. It DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports, a hdmi port, and a webcam. The webcam is nothing special, its there if you need it. Don't expect it to take good pictures or video. The battery is pretty soild. It lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use. The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch. The only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 (though YMMV) and the Dell crapware installed. I would strongly recommend to remove it and install Windows 7 on it with a usb drive. The performance will improve on it. Trust me.",negative,OS_GENERAL

337, My hp G60-244dx died after only 16 months. It started out getting hot after only a few months. I should have sent it back to them then. At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes. I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help. I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.

Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!). Enough said. The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk. The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then. Keyboard could use some trimming.

The screen is huge and coloful, but no LED backlighting. The video card is great for media, and above average for gaming, but not a gamers first choice. The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable. It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use, and would not move past this error. I realize that not every unit has this issue, but the ones that do cannot be repaired. I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return. Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3. They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.

The screen is wide and provides excellent clarity. In addition to some usage on the road, this is also my desktop unit. It is not a small, compact laptop, but I won't be traveling via air often, so its size and weight is not a problem for me.

348," I hate it. I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops. The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty. During that time, I had to send it back 3 times. I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me. None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing. They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem. The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went. I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble. I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty. I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty. I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT. I waited and waited and no laptop. Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box. I waited another month for approval and for them to ""BUILD"" me a new laptop. I was psyched. I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated. Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing. HP didn't fix it. I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one. I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!",negative,LAPTOP_GENERAL

About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash. Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING. One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers. After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.

360," I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers). The 13"" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable. It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours. It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb. It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics. It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing). The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing. Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience. However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming). Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.

It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing). The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing. Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience. However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming). Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.

It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs. Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work. I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems. It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me. Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros. But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it. I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

374," Shiny This Laptop is the Best of the best! The Awesomest of the awesomest. It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it! My friends are in awe every time they come over! I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up! It is super fast, and always loads. I am just amazed. The only bad part is the size/weight. It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT! If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you. It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily. It doesn't bother me though. It doesn't heat up like my old laptop. All for such a great price. It's color is even cool. Another Great thing is the Beast graphics. They are so realistic I am just speechless. I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease. The cool thing about this is anyone can use it. Mom, Dad, Brother, sister, You name it! I don't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook! The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile. I love it! I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more! We are addicted to the Mac.

So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message. I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use. Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook. Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.",neutral,LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES

The solid-state memory makes it a lot faster than previous MacBook Pro models that used a spinning hard drive. This computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations. Also, the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear, and everything is just sleek and smooth. The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me. No hardware issues, as is common with any Apple product. Great product, and couldn't be happier with it.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

382," Meh...but cheap. I bought this so that I could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than iPad was offering. The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review... The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic. So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine. Now the speed is disappointing. Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open. I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not. Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help. Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014. The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM. But alas they were gifts...and what is a gift if not given? All in all I wish I had waited a bit. But then again hindsight is 20/20. Bought a usb dvd rW drive but have not used it yet.",positive,LAPTOP_PRICE

383," Let me start with the good:So awesome. Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port. This is my second MacBook. The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro. I fell in love with it. This one has had the same effect. I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features. The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive. The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior. The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful. It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy. For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy. It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook. The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness. My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie. I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it. The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours. Enabling the battery timer is useless. The ""Time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes. It's a joke. It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something. I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like. This ain't it. My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-) If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro. I fell in love with it. This one has had the same effect. I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features. The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive. The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior. The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful. It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy. For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy. It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook. The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness. My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie. I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it. The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours. Enabling the battery timer is useless. The ""Time remaining"" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes. It's a joke. It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something. I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like. This ain't it.

385," I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009. Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop). That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought. My MacBook Pro is no exception. On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad. Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth. I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad. The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp. The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well. I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office). I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!",positive,COMPANY_GENERAL

I can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge. Also, I find OS X much more simple and easy to use than Windows. Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.",positive,MOUSE_GENERAL

387," I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room. Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings). I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine. I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive. The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16"" laptop does. I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out. The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week. Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.",positive,LAPTOP_DESIGN_FEATURES

The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation! The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)! After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer.

390," I've had this laptop for about a month now. It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part. The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown. The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft. My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range. Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft. My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range. Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.",negative,HARDWARE_QUALITY

391," My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made. I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it. The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead. If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer. I love this computer. Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done. Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software. The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to. Games being the main issue. It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software. I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be. Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!",positive,LAPTOP_GENERAL

394," This is without a doubt the worst laptop I've ever had. I wavered between another Toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and I'm so sorry I did. And of course, the return window closed last week so now, I'm stuck with it. I will never buy another Lenovo anything! Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don't buy this. The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities. This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has. The laptop has 4G and a 2.9g processor and it's slower than the four year old Toshiba I replaced. It hangs, freezes and just isn't working properly. I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open! Though I don't have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left! I have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense. Most of my things are stored in the cloud. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don't buy this one! It's definitely not worth the money.",negative,LAPTOP_GENERAL
