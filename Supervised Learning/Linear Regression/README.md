# Housing Cost Prediction

This repository contains Cleaning, Analysis and Visualisations of Housing Data, so as to apply Linear Regression Algorithm for predicting the cost of purchasing a house in a certain locality. 

Since the data to be predicted is distributional, the algorithm used here is Linear Regression.

This is a data science project performed in Semester 3.

Libraries used: Pandas, Seaborn, MatPlotLib
