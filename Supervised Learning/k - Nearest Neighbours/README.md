# KNN Implementation

This repository contains Analysis and Visualisations of Classified data, so as to apply k - Nearest Neighbor Algorithm for predicting the "Target Class" attribute.

This is a data science project performed in Semester 3.

Libraries used: Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, MatPlotLib

When to use k - Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (example):

Suppose the input provided is height and weight of an animal, prediction of what animal it can be is the output.
